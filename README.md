# HTMX-GPT
Note: This project has now been rewritten in Golang and combined into [AgentSmith](https://github.com/mattyleecifer/AgentSmith).

This is a OpenAI API interface with simple prompt editing controls for quick and easy prompt engineering built with HTMX.

The project was created to help me learn HTMX, but I found the edit features really helpful and it evolved into what it is now.
